        <!-- Introduction -->
        <li><h3><u>Introduction:</u></h3></li>
        <h4>Lasagna is a traditional Italian dish made by layering wide, flat pasta sheets with rich meat or vegetable sauces, creamy béchamel, and melted cheese—typically mozzarella and parmesan. Baked to perfection, it's a hearty, comforting meal known for its indulgent layers and robust flavors. Originating from the region of Emilia-Romagna, lasagna has evolved globally with countless regional variations. It’s both a culinary staple and a crowd-pleaser, often enjoyed during festive gatherings and family dinners.

    <h3><li><u><b>Directions:</b></u></li></h3>
    <h5> 
        <ol type="i">
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, garlic, basil, salt, oregano, and sugar. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and set aside. While the noodles are cooking, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, remaining 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until combined.</li>
            <li>Assemble lasagna: Spread a spoon or two of sauce over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish just to to coat it. Place two layers of noodles over the sauce to cover.</li>
            <li>Layer with 1/2 of the cheese mixture, 1/2 of the remaining sauce, and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers once more using the remaining noodles, cheese mixture, sauce, and mozzarella. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until cheese is golden brown, 5 to 10 more minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes before cutting and serving.</li>
